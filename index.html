        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
          So what is HTML?
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
        </p>
        <br>
        <center>

      <section id="CSS">
        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

      <section id="JS">
        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a text-based programming language that allows you to create interactive elements on your web page. 

The World Wide Web as we know it looks nothing like the early days of grey boxes and walls of text. Nowadays, we can’t imagine browsing the web without interactive websites, clickable buttons, and online video games. The ways we interact with the internet have radically changed over the years and, for the most part, it’s all down to JavaScript.

But all these new gadgets and gizmos are also putting a much larger strain on our browsers than ever before. In other words, the rise of JavaScript has also made keeping an eye on your site performance a crucial part of any online strategy.
